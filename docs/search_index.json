["overview.html", "Overview", " Overview This workshop provides an overview of the rstanarm and brms packages. Basic modeling syntax is provided, as well as diagnostic checking, model comparison, and how to get more from the models. Goals Note that it is not a goal of this workshop to teach Bayesian data analysis. However, by the end of the workshop, you should be well aware of what rstanarm and brms have to offer, and how to use them, as well as what steps you might take to get the most from your models. Prerequisites You should know how to do some standard regression modeling in R. While prior exposure to Bayesian analysis is in some sense a prerequisite, this can also be seen a stepping stone to Bayesian analysis. Once you see how easy it is to get more from standard models, and how easy it is to run more complicated models, you’ll likely want to use these tools even if you haven’t used the Bayesian approach before. Note the following color coding used in this document: emphasis package function object/class link "],

Alternatively, we can think also in terms of the posterior as the combination hypothesis, and evidence, in the form of data. \\[p(hypothesis|data) \\propto p(data|hypothesis)p(hypothesis)\\] \\[\\text{updated belief} = \\text{current evidence} * \\text{prior belief or evidence}\\] Some key distinctions: Distributions and uncertainty estimation instead of point estimates However, given the distribution for a parameter, we still obtain point estimates Easy model criticism http://micl.shinyapps.io/prior2post/ "],

One way to handle overdispersion in count models is to move to something like negative binomial or other approaches. Interestingly, for Poisson models we can have a random effect per observation (even in the non-Bayesian context)1.
