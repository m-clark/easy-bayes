["overview.html", "Overview", " Overview This workshop provides an overview of the rstanarm and brms packages. Basic modeling syntax is provided, as well as diagnostic checking, model comparison, and how to get more from the models. Goals Note that it is not a goal of this workshop to teach Bayesian data analysis. However, by the end of the workshop, you should be well aware of what rstanarm and brms have to offer, and how to use them, as well as what steps you might take to get the most from your models. Prerequisites You should know how to do some standard regression modeling in R. While prior exposure to Bayesian analysis is in some sense a prerequisite, this can also be seen a stepping stone to Bayesian analysis. Once you see how easy it is to get more from standard models, and how easy it is to run more complicated models, you’ll likely want to use these tools even if you haven’t used the Bayesian approach before.

(2013) : In the simulation literature (including earlier editions of this book), the warm-up period is called burn-in, a term we now avoid because we feel it draws a misleading analogy to industrial processes in which products are stressed in order to reveal defects. We prefer the term ‘warm-up’ to describe the early phase of the simulations in which the sequences get closer to the mass of the distribution. (see also, this discussion at Gelman’s blog)↩ "],

Want mcse than 10% of the posterior standard deviation. \\(n_{eff}\\): is an estimate of the effective number of independent draws from the posterior distribution of the estimand of interest. Because the draws within a chain are not independent if there is autocorrelation, the effective sample size will be smaller than the total number of iterations. Should be greater than 10% of max. \\(\\hat{R}\\): measures the ratio of the average variance of samples within each chain to the variance of the pooled samples across chains; if all chains are at equilibrium, these will be the same and R̂ will be one.

For each draw of the parameters θ from the posterior distribution p(θ | y, X) we generate an entire vector of outcomes.↩ "],

One way to handle overdispersion in count models is to move to something like negative binomial or other approaches. Interestingly, for Poisson models we can have a random effect per observation6 to model additional variance. In this case, our pp_check suggests a much better result. attendance_brms_add_re = update(attendance_brms, . ~ . + (1|id), newdata = attendance) pp_check(attendance_brms_add_re) For more on this see Ben Bolker’s demonstration with lme4. This essentially changes the model to incorporate a Poisson log-normal distribution. As Montesinos-López et al. (2017) describe: &gt; The Poisson component of the Poisson-lognormal distribution accommodates integer inputs (or outputs) to describe the actual number of counts observed within a single unit or sample, while the lognormal component of the distribution describes the overdispersion in the Poisson rate parameter…↩ "],
