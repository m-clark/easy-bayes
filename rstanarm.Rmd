# (PART\*) Part II: rstanarm {-}



# Getting started

- <span class="pack">rstan</span> installation required.
- Installed as any other R package


# Basic GLM

Whether a survey respondent agrees or disagrees with a conservative statement about the role of women in society

- 1974/1975 Survey
- Women should take care of running their homes and leave running the country up to men
- Modeled as a function of the gender and education of the respondents

## Traditional GLM

```{r basic_logistic_data_prep, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
data("womensrole", package = "HSAUR3")
womensrole = womensrole %>% 
  mutate(total = agree + disagree,
         agree50 = agree/total >= .5)
readr::write_csv(womensrole, 'data/womensrole.csv')
```

```{r basic_logistic, echo=-2, eval=-c(2,4)}
data("womensrole", package = "HSAUR3")
womensrole = readr::read_csv('data/womensrole.csv')
womensrole_glm <- glm(cbind(agree, disagree) ~ education + gender,
                        data = womensrole, 
                        family = binomial)
summary(womensrole_glm)
```

```{r basic_logistic_result, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
tidy(womensrole_glm) %>% 
  kable_df()
```


## rstanarm: GLM


```{r bayesian_logistic0, echo=FALSE}
womensrole_bglm <- stan_glm(cbind(agree, disagree) ~ education + gender,
                              data = womensrole,
                              family = binomial)
save(womensrole, womensrole_bglm, file = 'data/womensrole_bayes.RData')
```

```{r bayesian_logistic}
library(rstanarm)
womensrole_bglm <- stan_glm(cbind(agree, disagree) ~ education + gender,
                              data = womensrole,
                              family = binomial)
summary(womensrole_bglm, digits = 3)
```

```{r bayesian_logistic_pretty, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
load('data/womensrole_bayes.RData')
print(womensrole_bglm, digits = 3)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
print(womensrole_bglm, digits = 3)

# save for later
womensrole_bglm <- stan_glm(cbind(agree, disagree) ~ education + gender,
                              data = womensrole,
                              family = binomial(link = "logit"), 
                              prior = student_t(df = 7), 
                              prior_intercept = student_t(df = 7),
                              iter = 5000,
                              warmup = 2000,
                              thin = 10,
                              cores = 4, 
                              seed = 1234)

prior_summary(womensrole_bglm)
```



## rstanarm: Mixed Model

```{r mixed}
library(lme4)
sleepstudy_lmer <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days|Subject), data = sleepstudy)
summary(sleepstudy_lmer)
```

```{r bayesian_mixed, echo=-3}
sleepstudy_blmer <- stan_lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days|Subject), data = sleepstudy)
summary(sleepstudy_blmer)
save(sleepstudy_lmer, sleepstudy_blmer, sleepstudy_brms, file = 'data/sleepstudy_bayes.RData')
```

```{r load_mixed_models, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
load('data/sleepstudy_bayes.RData')
```
