# (PART\*) Part III: brms {-}

# Installation

- <span class="pack">rstan</span> installation required.
- Installed as any other R package


# Comparison to rstanarm

In general, <span class="pack">brms</span> offers more modeling capabilities, flexibility with priors, and more.

## Models in brms

The modeling syntax with brms mimics base R and some of the more popular packages:

- base R
- lme4
- mgcv
- survival

## brms: Mixed Model

```{r brms_mixed}
sleepstudy_brms <- brm(Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days|Subject), data = sleepstudy)
summary(sleepstudy_brms)
```

```{r brms_mixed_show, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
summary(sleepstudy_brms)
```



## brms: Mixed Model Extensions

- additional distributions: ordinal, zero-inflated, beta and many more
- Correlated residuals, Additive mixed models, non-linear with known form, heterogenous variance components, correlated random effects across multivariate outcomes, and more

```{r examples}
# auto regressive residual structure
model <- brm(Reaction ~ Days + (1 + Days|Subject), 
             data = sleepstudy, 
             correlation = cor_ar(~Days))

# multi-membership models
model <- brm(DV ~ x + (1|mm(group_1, group_2)), 
             data = sleepstudy, 
             correlation = cor_ar(~Days))

# smooth terms
model <- brm(Reaction ~ s(Days) + (1 + Days|Subject), 
             data = sleepstudy)

# use gaussian process instead
model <- brm(Reaction ~ gp(Days) + (1 + Days|Subject), 
             data = sleepstudy)



# multivarate outcome; q is an arbitrarily named identifier connecting random
# effects.
f1 = bf(DV_1 ~ x + 1|q|group)
f2 = bf(DV_2 ~ x + 1|q|group)
f = f1 + f2

model <- brm(f, data = mydata)

```


## brms: Mo' models, mo' models, mo' models!


- GAM (gp)
- Distributional response (e.g. model the variance as well as the mean)
- Gaussian Processes
- ZIP
- Multivariate
- Missing data
- Measurement error


```{r mo_models}




# non-linear model with known form
nlform <- bf(cum ~ ult * (1 - exp(-(dev / theta)^omega)),
             ult ~ 1 + (1 | AY), omega ~ 1, theta ~ 1, nl = TRUE)

# missing values
bform <- bf(bmi | mi() ~ age * mi(chl)) +
  bf(chl | mi() ~ age) + set_rescor(FALSE)
fit <- brm(bform, data = nhanes)

```
