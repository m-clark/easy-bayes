	abstract = {We extend and improve two existing methods of generating random correlation matrices, the onion method of Ghosh and Henderson [S. Ghosh, S.G. Henderson, Behavior of the norta method for correlated random vector generation as the dimension increases, ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS) 13 (3) (2003) 276–294] and the recently proposed method of Joe [H. Joe, Generating random correlation matrices based on partial correlations, Journal of Multivariate Analysis 97 (2006) 2177–2189] based on partial correlations. The latter is based on the so-called D -vine. We extend the methodology to any regular vine and study the relationship between the multiple correlation and partial correlations on a regular vine. We explain the onion method in terms of elliptical distributions and extend it to allow generating random correlation matrices from the same joint distribution as the vine method. The methods are compared in terms of time necessary to generate 5000 random correlation matrices of given dimensions.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and
sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC
methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order
gradient information. These features allow it to converge to
high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than
simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs
sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two
user-specified parameters: a step size ϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon and a desired
number of steps LL. In particular, if LL is too small then the
algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if
LL is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce
the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that
eliminates the need to set a number of steps LL. NUTS uses a
recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points
that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping
automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its
steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as
(and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC
method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning
runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size
parameter ϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon on the fly based on primal-dual averaging.
NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it
suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference
engines that require efficient “turnkey” samplers.},

	title = {Bayesian {Computation} with {R}},
	isbn = {978-0-387-92297-3},
	abstract = {There has been a dramatic growth in the development and application of Bayesian inferential methods. Some of this growth is due to the availability of powerful simulation-based algorithms to summarize posterior distributions. There has been also a growing interest in the use of the system R for statistical analyses. R's open source nature, free availability, and large number of contributor packages have made R the software of choice for many statisticians in education and industry. Bayesian Computation with R introduces Bayesian modeling by the use of computation using the R language. The early chapters present the basic tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and two-parameter inferential problems. Bayesian computational methods such as Laplace's method, rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are illustrated in the context of a random effects model. The construction and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced. These simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and binary response regression, hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference, and robust modeling. Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the posterior predictive distribution. The use of R to interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is described with several illustrative examples. This book is a suitable companion book for an introductory course on Bayesian methods and is valuable to the statistical practitioner who wishes to learn more about the R language and Bayesian methodology. The LearnBayes package, written by the author and available from the CRAN website, contains all of the R functions described in the book. The second edition contains several new topics such as the use of mixtures of conjugate priors and the use of Zellner’s g priors to choose between models in linear regression. There are more illustrations of the construction of informative prior distributions, such as the use of conditional means priors and multivariate normal priors in binary regressions. The new edition contains changes in the R code illustrations according to the latest edition of the LearnBayes package.},

	abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods have become widely used for data analysis and modelling in recent years, and the BUGS software has become the most popular software for Bayesian analysis worldwide. Authored by the team that originally developed this software, The BUGS Book provides a practical introduction to this program and its use. The text presents complete coverage of all the functionalities of BUGS, including prediction, missing data, model criticism, and prior sensitivity. It also features a large number of worked examples and a wide range of applications from various disciplines.  The book introduces regression models, techniques for criticism and comparison, and a wide range of modelling issues before going into the vital area of hierarchical models, one of the most common applications of Bayesian methods. It deals with essentials of modelling without getting bogged down in complexity. The book emphasises model criticism, model comparison, sensitivity analysis to alternative priors, and thoughtful choice of prior distributions—all those aspects of the "art" of modelling that are easily overlooked in more theoretical expositions.   More pragmatic than ideological, the authors systematically work through the large range of "tricks" that reveal the real power of the BUGS software, for example, dealing with missing data, censoring, grouped data, prediction, ranking, parameter constraints, and so on. Many of the examples are biostatistical, but they do not require domain knowledge and are generalisable to a wide range of other application areas.   Full code and data for examples, exercises, and some solutions can be found on the book’s website.},

	abstract = {When a plant scientist wishes to make genomic-enabled predictions of multiple traits measured in multiple individuals in multiple environments, the most common strategy for performing the analysis is to use a single trait at a time taking into account genotype × environment interaction (G × E), because there is a lack of comprehensive models that simultaneously take into account the correlated counting traits and G × E. For this reason, in this study we propose a multiple-trait and multiple-environment model for count data. The proposed model was developed under the Bayesian paradigm for which we developed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with noninformative priors. This allows obtaining all required full conditional distributions of the parameters leading to an exact Gibbs sampler for the posterior distribution. Our model was tested with simulated data and a real data set. Results show that the proposed multi-trait, multi-environment model is an attractive alternative for modeling multiple count traits measured in multiple environments.},
