## Stan 

Probabilistic programming language

HMC/NUTS

Compared to others: 

- Fast convergence
- No conjugacy required
- warm-up vs. burn-in[^warmup]
- less autocorrelation
- faster for more complex models

Why use?

- Fit very complex models
- Better approaches for model diagnostics
- Natural interval estimates for any statistic that comes out of a model

## rstan

<img src="img/bayes_doc/r_stan.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width=50%>
<br>

Allows one to use Stan within R

Driving force behind <span class="pack">rstanarm</span> and <span class="pack">brms</span>

Model can be: 

- a character string
- separate file with model expressed in the Stan language 

RStudio support for Stan (e.g. syntax highlighting)

<span class="pack">rstan</span> runs the model, and provides a lot of other tools to assess

```{r rstan_example}
results = stan(model_code = my_model, data = my_data_list)
```


We will not cover this package


## rstanarm

Developed by Stan team

Good for basic to intermediate, and even somewhat complex models

Pre-compiled Stan code

- Standard models run very quickly
- Without compilation will always be faster than <span class="pack">brms</span> for identical models


## brms

<img src="img/brms.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;" width=20%>

A framework for Bayesian regression models

Developed in collaboration with Stan team

- Almost exclusively by Paul-Christian Bürkner

Good for basic to complex models

Not pre-compiled

- Some simpler models with not much data would take longer for compilation than to actually run

Extremely rapid feature integration


##  More Stan

Many packages to explore the results of a Stan model 

- shinystan
- tidybayes 
- various model-specific packages etc.

[^warmup]: @gelman_bayesian_2013 : In the simulation literature (including earlier editions of this book), the warm-up period is called burn-in, a term we now avoid because we feel it draws a misleading analogy to industrial processes in which products are stressed in order to reveal defects. We prefer the term ‘warm-up’ to describe the early phase of the simulations in which the sequences get closer to the mass of the distribution.  (see also, this discussion at [Gelman's blog](https://andrewgelman.com/2017/12/15/burn-vs-warm-iterative-simulation-algorithms/))
