# Stan and the Stan ecosystem

## Stan

Probabilistic programming language

HMC/NUTS

Compared to others: 

- Fast convergence
- No conjugacy required
- warmup vs. burnin
- less autocorrelation
- faster for more complex models

###

```{stan, eval=F}
data {                      // Data block
  int<lower=1> N;           // Sample size
  int<lower=1> K;           // Dimension of model matrix
  matrix[N, K] X;           // Model Matrix
  vector[N] y;              // Target variable
}

parameters {                // Parameters block
  vector[K] beta;           // Coefficient vector
  real<lower=0> sigma;      // Error scale
}

model {                     // Model block
  vector[N] mu;
  mu = X * beta;            // Creation of linear predictor
  
  // priors
  beta ~ normal(0, 10);
  sigma ~ cauchy(0, 5);     // With sigma bounded at 0, this is half-cauchy
  
  // likelihood
  y ~ normal(mu, sigma);
}
```


## rstan

Allows one to use Stan within R.

Model can be a character string or separate file with model expressed in the Stan language 

- RStudio support for Stan (e.g. syntax highlighting)

rstan runs the model, and provides a lot of other tools to assess.

We will not cover this.


## rstanarm

Developed by Stan team.

Good for basic to intermediate and even somewhat complex models.

Precompiled stan code. 

- Standard models run very quickly


## brms

Developed along with Stan team (though by one person)

Good for basic to complex models.

Not pre-compiled

- Some simpler models with less data would take longer for compilation than to run.

Extremely rapid feature integration.

##  More Stan

Many package to explore the results of a Stan model from any of these packages.

- shinystan
- tidybayes etc.
